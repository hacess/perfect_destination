						<h3>Shangri-La Restaurant</h3><h5 align="center" style="font-size:20px"> (Indian, Chinese, Tibetan)</h5>
				</div>
<br>
As you walk a few steps from Glenary's towards the Chowrasta Mall, Shangri-La Restaurant will be on your right. It is actually part of a two storied old heritage building which is run as a hotel with only three rooms upstairs, and the restaurant is in the ground floor. As you walk in and cross the small reception cum lounge area, you will know that you are getting into a nice restaurant with an wooden decor, arches and great interiors. This in my view is one of the best restaurants of Darjeeling now considering the ambience, food and friendly service. 
 
You will get all kinds of food here including Chinese, north Indian style preparations, Tandoor items as well as sea food.I was surprised to see even Bengali style fish curry in the menu. There is also a nice bar at the end of the restaurant.

						<h3>Keventer's </h3><h5 align="center" style="font-size:20px">(English Breakfast & Snacks) </h5>
				</div>
					<br>
For us, a Darjeeling vacation is never complete without a breakfast at the Keventer's, and this is the reason why this restaurant appears on my list of best eateries. If you like to go for traditional English breakfast with items like great sandwiches, chicken salami & meat loafs, or pork sausages with eggs followed by a pot of perfect Darjeeling tea, this is the place to go. 
 
Located right at the beginning of Nehru Road that leads towards the Mall, this strange looking narrow building has two floors. The ground floor is a bakery. Climb up the stairs to enter the small cozy indoor area or just walk across to come out to the open terrace that has rot iron tables and chairs with lovely views all around. This is where I love to sit and have my breakfast while enjoying Kanchenjunga and the Nehru Road activities below. A sip at the tea while reading a newspaper and looking up at times to see how the clouds play at the mountains, is just something that I long for ever. If not for anything else, it can be just Keventer's why I can be in Darjeeling once again.

						<h3>Park Restaurant </h3><h5 align="center" style="font-size:20px">(Thai Cuisine & Others)</h5>
				</div>
					<br>
					Park is also one of our old time favorites. Located on Laden La road and right opposite to the State Bank of India building, this restaurant offers great Thai cuisine. As the owner Deep says, once you have Thai dishes, you won't like to have Chinese items as they would taste bland. However the restaurant does offer a far wider range of menu including North Indian and Chinese dishes. 
 
As you climb the short flight of stairs, you will enter into this well done up dining room that has a well stocked bar as well. On one side there are window side tables with great mountain views. There is also a small private room incase you are looking to dine in privacy.

						<h3>Lunar Restaurant</h3><h5 align="center" style="font-size:20px" >(Only Vegetarian, North & South Indian/Chinese)</h5>
				</div>
					<br>
					This vegetarian restaurant is located on Gandhi road next to the taxi stand and tucked between the Dekevas restaurant at the ground floor and the Dekeling hotel above. As you climb the flight of narrow stairs, it opens up into a nicely decorated and airy restaurant that has grand views of the mountains.  
 
					This restaurant is part of the Lunar Hotel located in the same building. They have a fairly long menu (like a booklet) of vegetarian dishes that includes both north and south Indian items, Chinese and snacks like sandwiches. If you are looking for some nice vegetarian food with nice ambience and views, this place can be a great choice.
